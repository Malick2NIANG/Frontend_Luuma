# Contributing

## Branch flow

Promote work through pull requests in this order:

`feature/*` → `develop` → `staging` → `preprod` → `main`

- Branch features and fixes from `develop`, then open a pull request into `develop`.
- Promote each integrated version with a pull request to the next branch.
- Do not push directly to the shared environment branches.
- `develop` is the intended default branch; `main` contains production-ready code.

## Pull request requirements

Require the `Frontend Android export` check before merging pull requests into `develop`, `staging`, `preprod`, and `main`.

Require no review approval for `develop`. Require at least one approved review for `staging`, `preprod`, and `main`.

Configure these rules in GitHub repository settings; the workflow cannot enforce branch protection by itself.

## Continuous integration and deployment

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm ci` and exports the Expo Android bundle on pull requests and pushes to the four shared branches.

This workflow provides CI only. Configure deployment separately once app signing, EAS credentials, release channels, and environment secrets have been decided.
